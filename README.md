# Health Data Research UK-Roche Summer School 

This summer school is being convened by [Health Data Research UK](http://www.hdruk.ac.uk) in partnership with [Roche](http://www.roche.com) and enabled through [UKRI Turing AI Fellowship](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/turing-artificial-intelligence-fellowships/turing-artificial-intelligence-fellowships) awarded to the lead organiser, [Professor Christopher Yau](https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/team/christoper-yau) at the University of Oxford.

## What is the purpose of the summer school?

The purpose of this Summer School is to provide an intensive period of industry-led training in health data science. The featured topic of this summer school is **single-cell imaging analysis**. 

During the event, participants will be introduced to the scientific utility of spatial single-cell imaging analysis. You will learn about the biological questions that motivate the use of spatial single-cell analysis, the technologies allowing data to be acquired, and the workflow of data processing required to convert acquired images into research-ready molecular and cellular analysis datasets. There will be time for participants to work in small groups to explore some exemplar data sets and tackle some research questions under the guidance of Roche scientists.

As part of the summer school, participants will have an opportunity to submit follow-on work for competitive internships made exclusively available by Roche.

## Who should apply?

The participants are expected to:

1. Be studying for a PhD in a substantively quantitative subject,
2. Have experience in biomedical or health data research,
3. Possess mature and competent programming abilities in a modern environment,

This summer school is unlikely to be suitable for those already with **direct** research experience of spatial single-cell analysis. 

If you wish to apply for internships, you will need to be eligible to work in the UK, EU or Switzerland.
