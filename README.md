# Health Data Research UK-Roche Summer School 

This summer school is being convened by [Health Data Research UK](http://www.hdruk.ac.uk) in partnership with [Roche](http://www.roche.com) and enabled through [UKRI Turing AI Fellowship](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/turing-artificial-intelligence-fellowships/turing-artificial-intelligence-fellowships) awarded to the lead organiser, [Professor Christopher Yau](https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/team/christoper-yau) at the University of Oxford. It forms part of our [Wellcome PhD programme in Health Data Science](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/further-education/phd-programme/).

## What is the purpose of the summer school?

The purpose of this Summer School is to provide an intensive period of industry-led training in health data science. The featured topic of this summer school is **single-cell imaging analysis**. 

During the event, participants will be introduced to the scientific utility of spatial single-cell imaging analysis. You will learn about the biological questions that motivate the use of spatial single-cell analysis, the technologies allowing data to be acquired, and the workflow of data processing required to convert acquired images into research-ready molecular and cellular analysis datasets. There will be time for participants to work in small groups to explore some exemplar data sets and tackle some research questions under the guidance of Roche scientists.

As part of the summer school, participants will have an opportunity to submit follow-on work for competitive internships made exclusively available by Roche.

## How much will it cost me to attend?

Thanks to sponsorship by Roche and support from Health Data Research UK, we have made the event *almost* completely free. 

There is no cost for tuition and accommodation for the event but participants will need to cover their own transport and some meals.

However, as we have experienced last-minute drop-outs in the past, we will be charging participants a registration fee of Â£100.

## Who should apply?

The participants are expected to:

1. Be studying for a PhD in a substantively quantitative subject,
2. Have experience in biomedical or health data research,
3. Possess mature and competent programming abilities in a modern environment.

This summer school is unlikely to be suitable for those already with **direct** research experience of spatial single-cell analysis.

If you wish to apply for internships, you will need to be eligible to work in the UK, EU or Switzerland.

## How do you register?

If you are interested in participating in the summer school, please express your interest using the [registration form](https://forms.gle/1TKE4WMYMJ5TL92q9).

The deadline for applications is **30 May 2023**.

After this date, applications will be screened for their basic eligibility and then places assigned randomly by lottery. A waiting list will be maintained for those who wish to be informed of withdrawals and late openings.

Please note that during an earlier expression of interest call, the number of registrations vastly exceeded the number of available places so please ensure your applications are complete and entered by the end date.
